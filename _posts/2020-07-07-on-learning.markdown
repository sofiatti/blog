Learning has been a core value of mine for as far as I can remember. It's been a driver for many of my major life decisions, and it's brought me much joy over the years. A bright shining sun in the sky that is my life. 

Sometime during grad school, that light went out. Acquiring new knowledge became laced with feelings of inadequacy and shame. I would sometimes feel dumb for not knowing something, and then I'd try to move past it without confronting my lack of knowledge. 

I wish I could have a do-over with my current mindset and maturity. I don't think my fate would have changed (leaving academia to pursue a career in Machine Learning), but I sure would have had more fun.  

Today, my learning philosophy can be summarized with three core ideas:

- Cultivate a beginner's mind. Approach learning with curiosity and wonder. Savor the delight of figuring something out. Explore for exploring's sake.

- "Wherever you are is fine." There is no "I should be here" or "I should know x." No matter where you find yourself in your path towards understanding or mastering a subject, wherever you are is _absolutely_ fine. 

- Learning is an active process of "trial and error, discovery, free inquiry." It should nourish the inventive soul. 

Most of all, learning something is a gift. One of the many blessings that make life worth living.
