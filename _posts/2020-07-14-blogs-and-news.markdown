Here is my **[Implementation Intention\*](https://jamesclear.com/implementation-intentions)**: 

> - On M-F, after I eat lunch, I will read an article then I will browse the blog list for the following day's article.
>
> - On the last Friday of each quarter I will spend my post-lunch break searching for new blogs and resources.
